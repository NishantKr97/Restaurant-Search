# Restaurant-Search
Restaurant Search is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of different Restaurants. 
It has a facility of admin login through which the admin can monitor the whole system. It has also a facility where the user after logging in their accounts can see list of restaurants present in and around the city. 
Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the admin and the user as well as the restaurant owners to maintain the details of the hotels in the best way possible and reduce the human efforts.
As we open the site there are two options one for the Admin and the other for the User. The Admin has permission to view, add and delete hotels. The User has permission to view and categorize hotels by:
1) Regions
2) Category
3) Rating
The user can also give reviews about the visited hotels.
The details of hotels contain:
1)Name
2)Place/Address
3)Rating 
4)Reviews
Then there is an option to logout.

This project uses the concepts of java which includes class, objects, methods, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, interface.
